# Quick Guide: Add Your Own Voice 🎙️

## Simple 3-Step Setup

### 1. Create Audio Folder
Make a folder: `c:\Users\srini\OneDrive\Documents\perazim\audio\`

### 2. Record Your Voice
Use Windows Voice Recorder app:
- Record: "Welcome! welcome kutty pappa!"
- Save as MP3 or WAV
- Keep it under 10 seconds

### 3. Save the File
- For all users: Save as `audio/welcome.mp3`
- For specific user: Save as `audio/welcome-john.mp3` (use lowercase username)

## How It Works

The system tries in this order:
1. **First**: `audio/welcome-{username}.mp3` (personalized)
2. **Second**: `audio/welcome.mp3` (generic)  
3. **Third**: Text-to-speech (automatic fallback)

## Test It

Currently uses text-to-speech saying:
**"Welcome [username]! welcome kutty pappa!"**

Add your audio files to hear your own voice instead! ✨

## No Files? No Problem!
If you don't add audio files, it automatically uses text-to-speech. Everything works either way!
